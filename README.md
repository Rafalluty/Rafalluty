### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# About Me

Manual tester. UX Designer. Professional driver. Individual and business customer service specialist. I have extensive experience in business management, trade and the transport industry. I am thorough and meticulous, I like challenges, I am constantly looking for new ways of developing. The way of analysing developed whilst working as a professional driver and Taxi Driver works well in end-to-end testing. My hobbies include running, swimming and walking my dog..
Every day I use and test the application for Uber drivers, and in my spare time I perform tests on the uTest platform (mainly functional and exploratory tests of mobile and web applications, test cases).
